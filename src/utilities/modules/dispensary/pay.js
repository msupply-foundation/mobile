/**
 * Helper method to pay off a prescription. After payment, the script
 * will be finalised.
 *
 * Paying a script has three paths: exact cash* payment, credit payment and
 * mixed cash+payment.
 * * [cash payment really meaning the patient has paid some amount that is not
 * credit]
 *
 * Every payment starts with a Receipt.
 * There are then two ReceiptLines created:
 * If there is a cash payment portion: create a ReceiptLine with an amount equal.
 * If there is a credit portion: create a ReceiptLine with the full amount of credit used.
 *
 * Then the amount of credit used needs to be reduced from the credit sources*.
 * * credit source: [Sources of credit are from customer_credit type Transactions, as well as
 * cancelled customer invoices. These invoices will have their outstanding field < 0 - where the
 * absolute value is the amount of credit the patient has from that source. I.e. a customer_credit
 * transaction with an outstanding equal to -20 shows the patient has $20 of credit]
 *
 * Using credit:
 * - Credit must not become negative.
 * - Credit must come from a credit source.
 * - A script must be paid off in full, no partial payments.
 *
 * To use credit, iterate over each credit source and reduce the outstanding value by the amount
 * of credit being used.
 *
 * @param {User} currentUser   The currently logged in user.
 * @param {Name} patient       A Name that is a patient
 * @param {Transaction} script A Transaction that is a prescription
 * @param {Number} cashAmount  The cash amount being paid for the script.
 * @param {Number} scriptTotal The total amount of the script.
