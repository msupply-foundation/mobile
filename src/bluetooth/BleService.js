 *
 * Sending commands:  There are simplified methods to send commands. Other methods are used

 *                    occurs.
 *                    - toggleButton      : Toggles the physical button of the sensor on/off
 *                    - getInfo           : Returns details about the sensor i.e batteryLevel
 *                    - downloadLogs      : Returns an array of downloaded temperature logs.
 *                    - blink             : Forces the LED light on the sensor to blink.
 *                    - updateLogInterval : Updates the logging interval of the sensor
